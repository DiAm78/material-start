AngularJS lets you write client-side web
applications as if you had a smarter browser.

Follow these steps to create an AngularJS application using the official project
template:

Note: We are choosing the PHP workspace type in order to have the Apache runner as a default so you can just click Run Project to get started. This doesn't
limit the choice of the backend technology you might want to use.

1. Create a workspace and choose the PHP workspace type
2. Open a Terminal, or using the pre-existing one at the bottom
3. Run the following commands in the Terminal:
    rm -rf * .c9
4. git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git angular-seed
5. cd angular-seed
6. npm install
7. mv package.json package.json.bak
8. jq '.scripts.start="http-server -a $IP -p $PORT"' package.json.bak > package.json
9. Click the Run Project button in the top menu of the IDE

10. Click on preview to view the app
